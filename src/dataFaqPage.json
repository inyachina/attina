      "answer": "Income insurance is for anyone who wants a safety net of financial security. However, certain factors can increase your need for income insurance and may be necessary if you:<li>Do not have sick or annual leave because you are self-employed or a small business owner.</li><li>Have family members or dependents who rely on your income.</li><li>Have debt that requires weekly, monthly, or annual payments even if you can't work.</li><br/>The earlier you jump on the income insurance train, the faster you are on track to financial security! If you are young and healthy now, then qualifying for a policy is easier and the premiums are much lower -- no reason to wait!"
